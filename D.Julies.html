                <h1>Experience</h1>
                <p>I started at Woolworths Cape Gate as a Warehouse Clerk from November 2020 to December 2020.
                     In this position, I was responsible for managing inventory, organizing stock, and ensuring that products were accurately accounted for and efficiently distributed. 
                     This role honed my attention to detail, ability to work under pressure, and reinforced the importance of teamwork in a fast-paced environment.
                      I was working as a Teacherâ€™s Assistant, a position I have held since January 2023. My responsibilities include supporting the classroom teacher, helping students with their learning activities, and contributing to the creation of a positive and inclusive learning environment. 
                      This experience has been incredibly rewarding, as it has allowed me to develop strong communication skills, patience, and a deeper understanding of how to work effectively with children.</p>
